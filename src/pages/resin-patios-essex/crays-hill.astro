            Unlike traditional patios and driveways that can crack or fade over time, resin bound driveways and patios are made of a tough material with superior weatherproofing qualities.

      <p class="mb-4">
        Aggregates are thoroughly mixed together prior to laying, ensuring that the surface has been completely coated with a protective layer of resin which will prevent anything from sticking or scraping it while also meeting <strong>Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) </strong>standards, which are designed to prevent standing water and and potential floods

        Resin patios are quickly becoming a popular choice for homeowners in Crays Hill.
     </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Resin patios are made up of a resin and aggregate mix, which is poured onto a prepared surface. The resin and aggregate mix then dries to form a hard, durable surface that can be used for patios, driveways, and more.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        One of the best things about resin patios is the fast installation time. In most cases, installation can be done in just one day. This means that you can enjoy your new driveway or patio sooner rather than later.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Additionally, resin bound patios are incredibly durable. They can withstand heavy traffic and will not crack or chip over time. This makes them a great choice for homeowners who want a patio or driveway that will last for years.
      </p>

        Once your resin driveway or patio is installed, it is important to take care of it properly to ensure that it lasts.
         </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        Here are a few tips on how to care for your resin patio:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc">
        <li class="mb-4 font-bold">Keep the surface clean and free of dirt and debris. Regularly sweep or hoover the to prevent any build-up.</li>
        <li class="mb-4 font-bold">If any stains or marks occur, clean them with a damp cloth immediately. Do not use any harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaning products as they may damage the surface of the resin.</li>
        <li class="mb-4 font-bold">If the patio becomes wet, allow it to dry naturally. Do not try to dry it with a blowtorch or any other type of heat source as this may damage the resin.</li>
        <li class="mb-4 font-bold">Protect the patio from sharp objects.
        </li>
    </ul>
