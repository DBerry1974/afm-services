        One of the biggest benefits of a tarmac driveway is that it is incredibly durable and long lasting. Tarmac is a type of asphalt, and as such it is resistant to weathering and staining. This means that your driveway will look great for years to come, no matter what the weather throws at it. Tarmac is also resistant to oil and petrol spills, so you don't have to worry about any nasty messes ruining your driveway. Tarmac is a strong material that can withstand the weight of vehicles, making it a perfect choice for driveways and also car parks.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Tarmac is a very low maintenance surface and is one of the most popular choices for driveways. All you need to do is sweep them regularly and apply a coat of asphalt sealant every few years.

                        This will protect your driveway from fading and staining, and it will keep it looking new for many years.
                        
                        Tarmac can also be resurfaced if it becomes damaged, which makes it a cost-effective option in the long run. Tarmac can be easily cleaned with a simple sweep or hose down, so you can keep it looking its best.
